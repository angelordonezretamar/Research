# Research Repo
* This repository includes files and programs from my research assistant position during the Spring and Summer of 2023

## What is the research?
* I worked in the Spring of 2023 as an undergraduate research assistant with Professor Pin-Kuang Lai
* The research was on predicting the bioavailability of monoclonal antbodies using machine learning
* Hopefully there will be a published paper soon on my research and it's results

# Repository for Research
* This repository includes files and programs from my research assistant position during the Spring and Summer of 2023

## What is the research?
* I am currently an undergraduate research assistant working with professor Pin-Kuang Lai
* The research is on predicting the bioavailability of monoclonal antbodies using machine learning
* Hopefully there will be a published paper soon on my research and it's results

## Relevant Papers
* [Machine Learning Attempts for Predicting Human Subcutaneous Bioavailability of Monoclonal Antibodies](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11095-021-03022-y)
